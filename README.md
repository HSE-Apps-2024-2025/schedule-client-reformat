# HSE Schedule v2

## Why v2? 
HSE Schedule v2 was created to build a new and improved format for HSE Schedule. While developers in past years did develop a great app, we decided that it was a best way to move forward in a direction of an entire rebuild and copy over certain files. Why? Because we could. Also the file system was a mess, and things like settings, component render placement, and other serious issues needed a major overhaul.

### How to contribute?
Go to HSE Apps and talk. Any help is appreciated. 

### How to build
First, clone the repo, `yarn install`, then `yarn start`. That should get you a local version. If you are a dev, in order to push changes to the backend, you must work on Schedule-API and the Admin App as well. Make sure you know where those are...
