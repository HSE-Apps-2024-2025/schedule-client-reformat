# Lunch Component Documentation

## Overview
The `Lunch` component is a placeholder for a future lunch-related view in the application. Currently, it renders only a simple Box component with the text "Lunch".

## Functionality

### Placeholder
- Currently serves as a placeholder for future functionality
- Renders a minimal UI with just the text "Lunch"
- Provides a foundation for implementing lunch-related features

### Future Potential
- Could display lunch schedules
- Might show lunch menu information
- Could integrate with lunch period timing from the schedule
- May provide lunch-specific notifications or reminders

## UI Elements

### Container
- Simple Chakra UI Box component
- Contains only the text "Lunch"
- No additional styling or functionality currently

## Usage Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Lunch from './components/views/lunch/lunch';

function LunchContainer() {
  return (
    <div className="content-container">
      <h1>Lunch Information</h1>
      <Lunch />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Related Components
