# Settings Component Documentation

## Overview
The `Settings` component provides a user interface for configuring application settings. It allows users to toggle dark mode, select lunch periods for different day types, and configure other preferences.

## Props

| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `loading` | boolean | Indicates whether the data is currently being loaded |
| `setLoading` | function | Callback function to update the loading state |

## Functionality

### Settings Management
- Uses the `useSettings` hook to access and update global settings
- Maintains local state for form inputs during editing
- Syncs local state with global settings on initial load and changes
- Provides a form interface for modifying settings

### Form Handling
- Tracks local changes in component state before submission
- Updates global settings only when the user confirms changes
- Supports different input types (switches, radio groups)
- Handles change events for all setting types

## UI Elements

### Container
- Main Box container for the entire settings interface
- Simple header with "Settings" text

### Form Fields
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle switch for enabling/disabling dark mode
- **Royal Lunch**: Radio group for selecting lunch period on Royal/Blue days (A/B/C/D)
- **Gray Lunch**: Radio group for selecting lunch period on Gray days (A/B/C/D)
- **Snow**: Toggle switch for enabling/disabling snow effects

### Control Buttons
- **Cancel**: Button to dismiss changes (currently non-functional)
- **Update Settings**: Button to save changes to global settings

## Usage Example

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import Settings from './components/views/settings/settings';

function SettingsContainer() {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  
  return (
    <div className="content-container">
      <Settings 
        loading={isLoading} 
        setLoading={setIsLoading} 
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Settings Structure

The component manages the following settings:

```javascript
{
  darkmode: boolean,    // Controls app-wide dark mode
  royalLunch: string,   // Selected lunch period for Royal/Blue days (A/B/C/D)
  grayLunch: string,    // Selected lunch period for Gray days (A/B/C/D)
  snow: boolean         // Controls snow visual effects
}
```

## Related Components

- **SettingsProvider**: Context provider that makes settings available app-wide
- **useSettings**: Hook for accessing and updating settings
- **Views**: Parent component that conditionally renders the Settings view

## Human Notes

This component provides a simple interface for users to configure application preferences. Settings are persisted through the useSettings hook, which saves them to localStorage. The current UI is minimal and could be enhanced with additional styling or grouped settings for better organization.
