# Theme Component Documentation

## Overview
The `Theme` component is a container for theme-related background elements in the application. It renders the `ThemeBackground` component, which provides the actual visual styling for the application background.

## Usage

The Theme component doesn't accept any props and is designed as an intermediary container in the theming system.

## Functionality

### Theme Management
- Acts as a wrapper for theme-related components
- Contains the `ThemeBackground` component
- Provides a consistent interface for the background theming system

## UI Elements

### Container
- A simple Chakra UI Box component that serves as a wrapper
- Does not apply any specific styling itself
- Delegates visual styling responsibilities to the ThemeBackground component

## Usage Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Theme from './components/backgrounds/theme/theme';

function BackgroundContainer() {
  return (
    <div className="background-container">
      <Theme />
    </div>
  );
}
```
