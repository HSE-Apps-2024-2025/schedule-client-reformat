# ThemeBackground Component Documentation

## Overview
The `ThemeBackground` component provides the actual visual styling for the application's background. It renders a Box component that fills the entire viewport.

## Usage

The ThemeBackground component doesn't accept any props and is designed to create a full-viewport background layer.

## Functionality

### Background Rendering
- Creates a Box element that spans the entire viewport (100vh height, 100vw width)
- Serves as the canvas for theme-based styling
- Provides a consistent background for the entire application

## UI Elements

### Full Viewport Box
- A Chakra UI Box component sized to fill the entire viewport
- Height: 100vh (viewport height)
- Width: 100vw (viewport width)
- No additional styling applied directly in the component
- Visual styling is controlled by theme variables and CSS

## Usage Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ThemeBackground from './components/backgrounds/theme/theme_backgrounds/ThemeBackground';

function ThemeContainer() {
  return (
    <div className="theme-container">
      <ThemeBackground />
    </div>
  );
}
```
