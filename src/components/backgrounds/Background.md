# Background Component Documentation

## Overview
The `Background` component serves as a container for theme-related background elements in the application. It wraps the `Theme` component, creating a backdrop for the application's content.

## Usage

The Background component doesn't accept any props and is designed to be used as a base layer in the application's layout hierarchy.

## Functionality

### Layer Management
- Provides a base Box container from Chakra UI
- Contains the `Theme` component which controls the visual appearance of the background
- Serves as the lowest z-index layer in the application's layout stack

## UI Elements

### Container
- A simple Chakra UI Box component that acts as a wrapper
- Does not apply any specific styling itself
- Allows the Theme component to control the visual appearance

## Usage Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Background from './components/backgrounds/Background';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="app">
      <div className="content">
        {/* Application content */}
      </div>
      <Background />
    </div>
  );
}
```
