# ThemeProvider Documentation

## Overview
The `ThemeProvider` component implements a theme context for the application, enabling components to access and toggle between light and dark themes. It provides a consistent theming approach across the application.

## Components

### ThemeProvider

A context provider component that:
- Manages the current theme state ('light' or 'dark')
- Provides a function to toggle between themes
- Makes theme information available to all child components

### useTheme Hook

A custom hook that:
- Provides access to the current theme and toggle function
- Can be used within any component inside the ThemeProvider
- Returns an object with `{ theme, toggleTheme }` properties

## Functionality

### Theme Management
- Stores the current theme ('light' or 'dark') in state
- Default theme is 'light'
- Provides a toggle function to switch between themes
- Makes theme information available through React Context

### Component Integration
- Wraps child components to provide theme context
- Works alongside Chakra UI for consistent theming
- Can be used with CSS variables defined in theme.css

## Usage

### Provider Setup

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { ThemeProvider } from './themes/themeProvider';
import App from './App';

function Root() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <App />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

### Consuming Theme in Components

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useTheme } from './themes/themeProvider';

function ThemeToggleButton() {
  const { theme, toggleTheme } = useTheme();
  
  return (
    <button onClick={toggleTheme}>
      Current theme: {theme}. Click to toggle.
    </button>
  );
}
```

## API

### ThemeProvider Props

| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `children` | ReactNode | Child components that will have access to theme context |

### useTheme Return Value

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `theme` | string | The current theme ('light' or 'dark') |
| `toggleTheme` | function | Function to toggle between light and dark themes |

## Integration with CSS

This provider works with the CSS variables defined in theme.css, which provides different color schemes based on the `data-theme` attribute. To fully implement theme switching, components need to apply the current theme to the HTML element:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useTheme } from './themes/themeProvider';

function ThemeApplier() {
  const { theme } = useTheme();
  
  React.useEffect(() => {
    document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', theme);
  }, [theme]);
  
  return null; // This component doesn't render anything
}
```

## Related Components

- **Settings**: May provide UI for changing theme preferences
- **Background**: May adapt visuals based on current theme
- **ThemeBackground**: May implement specific theme visuals

## Human Notes

This theme provider implements a simple theme switching mechanism that can be expanded to support additional themes beyond just light and dark. It works alongside the CSS variables defined in theme.css but doesn't automatically apply the theme to the DOM - components using the theme need to handle that aspect.
